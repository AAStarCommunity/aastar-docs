Defined in: [packages/airaccount/src/server/services/recovery-service.ts:32](https://github.com/AAStarCommunity/aastar-sdk/blob/3f8cdd383a819db0bbb2a41052f39ff7981a46dc/packages/airaccount/src/server/services/recovery-service.ts#L32)

RECOVERY_THRESHOLD — number of distinct guardian approvals required to recover
(or to cancel a recovery). The contract hard-codes `RECOVERY_THRESHOLD = 2`
against a maximum of 3 guardians, i.e. a 2-of-3 social-recovery scheme.

Source of truth: `AAStarAirAccountBase.RECOVERY_THRESHOLD` (internal constant).
